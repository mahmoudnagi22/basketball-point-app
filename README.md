A new Flutter project.

Score Counter App Description:

The Score Counter app is a simple yet handy application designed for sports enthusiasts, coaches, and referees to keep track of scores during football, basketball, or any other sport matches. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to increment or decrement the score manually with just a few taps on their mobile device.

Key Features:

1. Score Tracking:
   - The app displays two separate counters, one for each team or player.
   - Users can easily increment or decrement the score for each team/player by tapping the corresponding "+" or "-" buttons.

2. Reset Functionality:
   - In case a new game or set needs to be started, the app provides a "Reset" button that resets both counters to zero with a single tap.

3. Intuitive User Interface:
   - The app features a clean and minimalistic design, ensuring easy readability of the scores from a distance.
   - Large, bold fonts are used for the score counters, making them visible even in challenging lighting conditions.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
   - Developed using Flutter, a cross-platform framework, the Score Counter app can run seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.

5. Offline Functionality:
   - No internet connection is required to use the Score Counter app, as it operates entirely offline, ensuring uninterrupted scoring during matches or events.

The Score Counter app is an essential tool for anyone involved in sports, providing a simple and efficient way to keep track of scores without the need for complicated calculations or external devices. Its user-friendly interface and straightforward functionality make it accessible to users of all ages and technical backgrounds.
